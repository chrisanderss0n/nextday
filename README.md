# nextday
<h1>nextday helps you find week-days.</h1>

You give the library a date, and it tells you the date of the next week-day.

Give the library a date, and a number of days and it will tell you the date of the next week-day N week-days from your date.

The library accounts for week-ends, months and years...but not holidays (yet).

I did not intend to build this library.  I was building my company website, and just wanted to display the second business day from the current day on the page.  Sounds simple enough right?

I expected it would take me 30 mins to get that task done, and here we are with this library instead.

Enjoy!
