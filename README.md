# nextday helps you find week-days.

You give the library a date and an optional number of days, and it returns to you a date of a week-day that fits your criteria.

<h2>Example questions this library will answer</h2>

- What is the next week-day from today?
- What is the 3rd week-day from today?
- What is 20th week-day from today?
- What is the 7th week-day from yesterday?
- What is the 1st week-day from December 31st?

The library accounts for week-ends, months and years...but not holidays (yet).

I did not intend to build this library.  I was building my company website (http://nycode.co), and just wanted to display the second business day from the current day on the page.  Sounds simple enough right?

I expected it would take me 30 mins to get that task done, and here we are with this library instead.

Enjoy!
